Task Manager

Create a basic Task Manager application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task should have a name, description, and a status (such as "Pending", "In Progress", "Completed", etc.). Users should be able to:

Add a new task by providing a name, description, and selecting a status from a dropdown menu.
View a list of all tasks with their details.
Edit an existing task's name, description, and status.
Delete a task.
Mark a task as completed.
Here's a basic outline of the steps you can follow to implement this project:

Create a new WinForms project in Visual Studio.
Design the user interface:
Add labels, textboxes, dropdown menus, and buttons for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks.
Use a DataGridView to display the list of tasks.
Create a Task class to represent each task with properties like name, description, and status.

Implement functionality:
Create methods to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
Use event handlers for button clicks to trigger these methods.
Handle user interactions:
When the user selects a task from the DataGridView, display its details in the appropriate controls (textboxes, dropdowns).
Allow the user to edit these details and update the task accordingly.
Ensure validation:
Validate user input to ensure that tasks have valid names and descriptions.
Confirm with the user before deleting a task.
Test the application thoroughly to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
This project provides a good opportunity to practice basic WinForms development skills, including designing user interfaces, handling events, working with data, and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Good luck with your project!
